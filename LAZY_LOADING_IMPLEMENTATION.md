# Lazy Loading Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented intelligent lazy loading for county boundaries to improve map performance, with viewport-aware prioritization and smooth user experience.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. **Priority-Based Loading System**
- **High Priority**: Counties in current viewport (load immediately, 3 concurrent)
- **Medium Priority**: Counties near viewport (slight delay, 2 concurrent) 
- **Low Priority**: Distant counties (background loading, 1 sequential with increasing delays)

### 2. **Viewport-Aware Intelligence**
- Counties within or near current view bounds load first
- Dynamic re-prioritization when user pans/zooms
- Automatic cancellation when zooming out of DMA
- **ENHANCED**: DMA change detection during panning - counties automatically load when dragging between DMAs at high zoom

### 3. **Smart DMA Detection**
- Detects DMA entry on manual zoom-in (zoom >= 8)
- **NEW**: Detects DMA changes when panning/dragging at high zoom levels
- Automatic county loading when moving between DMAs
- Proper cleanup when moving outside DMA boundaries
- Sophisticated job queue with priority sorting
- Batch processing with configurable delays
- Abort controller for canceling operations

### 4. **Visual Loading Indicators**
- Real-time progress indicator showing:
  - Current loading phase ("Loading counties in view..." vs "Loading remaining counties...")
  - Progress counter (loaded/total)
  - Animated spinner

## Technical Implementation

### New Components Added

#### `useCountySelection.ts` Enhancements:
- `LazyLoadingState` interface for tracking progress
- `CountyLoadingJob` interface for queue management
- Utility functions: `calculateDistance()`, `isInViewportBounds()`, `prioritizeCounties()`
- Queue processing: `processJobBatch()`, `processLoadingQueue()`
- Main functions: `lazyLoadCountyBoundaries()`, `updateViewportPriority()`, `cancelLazyLoading()`
- Backward compatibility: `preloadCountyBoundary()` maintained

#### `LeadsMap/index.tsx` Integration:
- Updated `handleViewportChange()` with viewport priority updates
- Modified `handleDMAClick()` to use lazy loading
- Added loading progress indicator UI
- Automatic cancellation on DMA zoom-out

## Performance Benefits

### Before:
- All counties loaded simultaneously when zooming into DMA
- High API call volume causing delays
- Poor user experience with slow boundary appearance

### After:
- **Viewport counties**: Load immediately (visible within ~100-300ms)
- **Nearby counties**: Load with minimal delay (smooth panning experience)
- **Distant counties**: Load in background without affecting UX
- **Smart cancellation**: Avoids unnecessary loading when user navigates away

## Loading Strategy Details

### High Priority (Viewport Counties)
- Batch size: 3 concurrent requests
- Delay between batches: 100ms
- Immediately visible counties for instant feedback

### Medium Priority (Near Viewport)
- Batch size: 2 concurrent requests  
- Delay between batches: 200ms
- Counties just outside view for smooth panning

### Low Priority (Background)
- Batch size: 1 sequential request
- Delay between batches: 500ms
- Distant counties loaded without impacting performance

## User Experience Improvements

1. **Instant Feedback**: Counties in view appear immediately
2. **Smooth Panning**: Nearby counties pre-loaded for seamless movement
3. **No Blocking**: Background loading doesn't interfere with interactions
4. **Progress Visibility**: Users see loading status and progress
5. **Smart Cancellation**: Unnecessary loading stops when navigating away

## Backward Compatibility

- All existing DMA zoom/click functionality preserved
- County selection behavior unchanged
- `preloadCountyBoundary()` function maintained for legacy usage
- No breaking changes to existing API

## Testing Recommendations

1. **DMA Click**: Test clicking different DMAs to see prioritized loading
2. **Manual Zoom**: Zoom manually into DMA areas (zoom >= 8) to trigger auto-detection
3. **Viewport Changes**: Pan around during loading to see re-prioritization
4. **Progress Indicator**: Observe loading progress in the top banner
5. **Performance**: Compare loading times before/after implementation
6. **ðŸ†• DMA Panning**: Drag/pan between DMAs at high zoom - counties should automatically load for new DMA

## Configuration Options

### Easily Adjustable Parameters:
- **Batch sizes**: Currently 3/2/1 for high/medium/low priority
- **Delays**: Currently 100ms/200ms/500ms between batches
- **Distance thresholds**: Currently 1 degree for high vs medium priority
- **Viewport padding**: Currently 0.5 degrees for boundary detection

## Future Enhancements

1. **Caching**: Implement browser storage for loaded boundaries
2. **Predictive Loading**: Load counties in direction of user movement
3. **Adaptive Batch Sizes**: Adjust based on device performance
4. **Network-Aware**: Modify strategy based on connection speed

This implementation provides a robust, scalable foundation for efficient county boundary loading while maintaining excellent user experience.
